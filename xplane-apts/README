xplane-get-apts

This script downloads all the recommended sceneries from the X-Plane Gateway
and concatenates them into a single apt.dat.

The downloaded airports are cached and the process may be stopped and resumed
at any time.

To create an updated airports file, delete out/json.meta and run the script
-- only the updated airports will be downloaded from the gateway.
